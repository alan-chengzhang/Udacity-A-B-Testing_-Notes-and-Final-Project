# Udacity-A-B-Testing_Notes-and-Final-Project
  It includes my hand-written note while taking the Udacity A/B testing Course and the report of final project together with the Excel that generated those numeric results 

1. Project

  The project is from Udacity. It's a real-work situation that the company want to lauch a new feature and do an A/B tesing, which cover 
all the aspects for an A/B testing. This project let me implement all the basic and important points I learned in class. Besides, I cross
check my analysis with some other analysis in github. So, all the numeric results are 100% right. As for the discussion, 
conclusion and future experiment, I believe my point of view is more solid, more detailed and more related for the propose of this 
experiment than many other reports.

  My report includes my detailed analysis and the Excel files includes the calulation process of numeric answers.
